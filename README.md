# AdventureWorks Data Visualization Project

## Introduction

The AdventureWorks Data Visualization Project aims to provide meaningful business insights through easily comprehensible data visualizations.
By leveraging the AdventureWorks sample databases from Microsoft, we empower users to perform self-service analytics,
enabling them to gain actionable insights and make informed decisions.

## Tools Used

- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**: Used for database management, querying, and data manipulation tasks.
- **Power Query**: Integrated with Power BI for data preparation and transformation tasks.
- **Power BI**: Employed for creating interactive and visually appealing data visualizations and dashboards.
- **Figma**: Utilized for designing user interface layouts.

## Data Source

The project utilizes the AdventureWorks sample databases provided by Microsoft.
These databases contain a wide range of fictional bicycle manufacturing and sales operations data.
You can download and install the AdventureWorks sample databases from [Microsoft's official website](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver15&tabs=ssms).

## How I Started  
1. **Download and Install AdventureWorks Sample Databases**:  
   Visit [Microsoft's official website](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver15&tabs=ssms) to download and setup the AdventureWorks sample databases.  

2. **Explore Data Using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**:  
   Use SSMS to explore the AdventureWorks databases, run queries, and export the data to CSV. You can find the Queries of this project [here](https://github.com/a-elgohary/Adventure_Works/tree/master/SQL).  

4. **Data Preparation and Transformation with Power Query**:  
   Import the data exported from AdventureWorks databases into Power BI and utilize Power Query to clean, transform, and shape data according to the analysis requirements.  

5. **Data Modeling with Power BI**:  
   Define relationships between different tables, create calculated columns and measures using DAX, and optimize the data structure for efficient analysis.  

6. **Write the base analysis DAX**:  
   Identify key metrics and calculations required for the analysis, and lay the groundwork with solid DAX calculations to create meaningful visualizations and derive actionable insights.

7. **Create Visualizations Using Power BI**:  
   Create insightful visualizations and dashboards to extract actionable insights.  

8. **Design User Interface Layouts Using Figma**:  
   Design user-friendly and visually appealing interface layouts using Figma, ensuring a seamless user experience.
